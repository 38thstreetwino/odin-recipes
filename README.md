Odin Recipes

This project will display and document my initial explorations of HTML and eventually CSS
and JavaScript.  I will be getting familiar with using Git, command line, and HTML by crafting
a simple recipe website.  This will be my first foray into web development as well as any kind 
of coding.

Resuming! Getting back on track!
